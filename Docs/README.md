Extra Innings Softball - Player Ranking System
Overview
The Extra Innings Softball Player Ranking System is designed to rank players in a national softball league based on various performance statistics. This project utilizes Python and the Pandas library to read, process, and export player data in Excel format, allowing for efficient management and analysis of player rankings.

Features

Excel Integration: Uses Pandas to read player statistics from Excel worksheets and export ranked results back into formatted Excel sheets.
Object-Oriented Design: The system is built using an object-oriented programming approach, ensuring modularity, scalability, and maintainability.
Automated Ranking: Automatically scales and ranks players according to predefined weightings for each statistic, providing a comprehensive view of player performance.
