Early on at a young age she excelled at catcher to allow us to play at a high level and still catches now as her secondary position. In the outfield (which is her passion) she has excelled for many years now and I believe one of the best in the country at her age. As just a 7th and 8th grader she has started on Varsity for her high school in the outfield and been one of the most consistent bats for her high school team where they made a strong run at State last year and are on their way there again this year. In travel ball she is a well known player on our club team and has one of the strongest arms of any kid I’ve seen at her age. Whether in the outfield or behind the plate her arm strength is respected by other teams. She is a 3 sport athlete and excels in all. I firmly believe she will have the opportunity to play division 1 in Softball and offers in Volleyball as well. Haley is that clutch player that always shines in tough situations.

As a top-notch catcher in the 2028 class, she consistently pushes herself to the next level in every aspect of the game.  Behind the plate, her arm is a force to be reckoned with, deterring even the most daring base runners.  Paityn is equally formidable in center field.  Her range and ability to track down balls is exceptional, putting her on par with centerfielders in higher age divisions.
Paityn is an offensive threat every time she steps to the plate.  Her lightning-fast hands makes her one of the hardest outs in the game, and enables her high contact rate and high on base percentage. This is key in clutch situations where she thrives, as she can always be counted on to put the ball in play and advance runners.

She is currently ranked 4th in Alliance for the 2028 class with 45 stolen bases. Her catching stats are a stand out with 14 CS. Not to many after seeing her arm tempt to steal a base on her.
Beyond her on-field achievements, Paityn has earned high praise from coaches, teammates, and fellow softball enthusiasts. Her dedication to being the best player possible is evident in her work ethic, game knowledge, and positive attitude.  You would be hard pressed to find someone who works harder than Paityn, as she has a steady routine of practicing game skills (hitting, fielding), taking catching lessons, weight lifting and speed and agility training to improve herself as a player and help her team achieve their goals.
As a team player, Paityn has showcased her ability to lead her team with a combination of drive, charisma, and an in-depth understanding of the game. Her contributions make her a valuable asset, and she embodies the spirit of a true softball player.  Paityn's multifaceted skills, leadership qualities, and dedication to the game make her an exceptional player and a true asset to any team.""","Paityn has wrestled for her middle school and took 3rd in Districts.

I knew the reputation and heard the name, but never really got to see Tara in action.  Her Dad, Kevin reached out to us asking if we were looking to add another pitcher.  To make a long story short, we did a tryout and within a week I knew that we were adding a difference maker for our already stacked team and rotation.  Tara is a 2028 playing on a top 2027 team.  She holds her own in the circle and at the plate competing with older elite competition.  Tara is a high velocity power pitcher 63-65 (topped out at 67) kid with a ton of spin and command.  She also has a very effective change up.  This past Fall with us Tara threw 37 innings for us, striking out 55 and only walking 14.  For her former team Hustle, she threw 176 innings last year with a little over 200 strikeouts.  
At the plate she can also swing the stick, consistently hitting over .400 with homer run power.  Actually, Tara's first at bat with IG 2K9 last fall was a 3 run bomb.  
Tara was previously ranked in the top 10 by Extra Innings, she is an elite level pitcher for any age.  Tara is a difference maker on any team that she plays for.","TFL Juniors Ship - Pitcher of Tournament

At catcher, she showcases a strong, accurate arm with a quick release, made all the more effective by her quickness behind the plate. She has the complete confidence of her hard-throwing Atlanta Vipers pitching staff due to her mobility, ability to block and pick pitches well-outside the strike zone, penchant for “stealing” strikes with her receiving, and her positive attitude no matter the circumstances of the game. Hayden is also a smart, reliable hitter and baserunner who batted .321 and only struck out once in 37 plate appearances while playing for her school team at Buford, a powerhouse in Georgia athletics. In the outfield, the same quickness and spatial senses that make her an excellent basketball guard produce quick, accurate routes and extraordinary catches. Her arm strength also means that she's just as likely to throw out ambitious runners from the outfield as she is from behind the plate. Hayden's Vipers team values her ability to plug in on the infield, as well. Coach Crenshaw says “It’s a luxury to have a player like Hayden whose skills and athleticism give us so many lineup options - her ability to play almost every position on the field makes everyone around her better.”","County Champions-undefeated season- Buford Middle School

Her left-handed swing combines contact and power making her a true asset to any team. Since joining our team three years ago, Kenzie has been a cornerstone player, with exceptional defense skills, making her one of the best first basemen in the 09 class regardless of class year.

Kenzie is not only consistent at the plate, but also a standout performer. She has only struck out seven times in nearly 200 at-bats and has hit over 20 extra-base hits. She is an incredibly reliable hitter responsible for almost 50 runs batted in and 50 runs scored, with our entire offense built around her. With an exit velocity of 74MPH, she has the power to hit the ball deep, making her a true offensive force.

But Kenzie is more than just a player. She's a natural leader, someone who coaches look up to and want on their team. Even though she's only in eighth grade, Power Five coaches from across the country have started to take notice of her abilities. With her leadership qualities and ability to hold others accountable, she is the type of player that coaches build entire teams around.

In conclusion, Kenzie is an indispensable player, a true asset, and a natural leader. With her skills and abilities, she stands out as the type of player that every coach wants on their team.  She absolutely deserves to be recognized as one of the top 10 players in the country.",4.0 GPA,"•	PGF Super Select 13u Championship

She is trained by Power House Mechanics which focuses on Spin & Spots
She has proven to be one of the Top 5 arms in the country over the last two years.
When not in the circle or launching balls out of the batters box, Tempe is a true Utility player that can hold down the corners of the Outfield as well as the corners of the Infield.
What we all are most proud of her for is that Tempe is as humble as they come and a true ‘Bring your Lunch-pal to work type player with an outstanding work ethic and always there to pick up a teammate or classmate.

She is charting a path toward a successful D1 career with unbound potential.

She is lighting in a bottle; a natural and beautiful left-handed swing that emphasizes hard, consistent, line-drive contact with an ability to slap, drag, or bunt her way on to base.  Her speed is best-in-class; she's probably the fastest player in the state going for multiple bases.

On defense, Olivia is a catcher outfield combo with a strong accurate arm that is only getting stronger.  Due to her athleticism and speed, Olivia excels at blocker and lateral movement, rarely seeing passed balls.  This year we are encouraging her to snap throw at every advantage an build on her strong offseason program to ""let it loose"" with her arm.

This year, we will get to see how fast and effortlessly she develops into an absolute top regional and national player.  We are excited withing Lasers to see her this year!

She hits out of the 4 or 5 spot and when opposing coaches she her size they constantly move their outfield up, only to have her consistently hit doubles and triples over the outfields heads.  Both last Fall and Spring she was amongst the highest batters on the team for doubles and triples. She also led the team in singles this last fall.  

Pitching is the same thing. Opposing coaches see her size and move their batters up in the box.  Her ability to hit her spots and spin the ball is second to none. She will blow a 55 mph high and inside fast ball by the batter only to then throw a curve ball low and away. Finally finishing off the batter with a devastating change up; one of the best I've seen.    Her stats don't really convey how good she is at getting batters to pop up or ground out.","As well as being an outstanding softball player, she is also a nationally ranked gymnast.  Currently she is ranked 3rd in her age group for trampoline and 4th in double mini.  She also plays the concert viola.  Her GPA is a 3.8.  She also volunteers at ""Undies for Everyone"", a non-profit organization that provides underwear to kids.","- Cowart Sports 2nd Annual H-Town Classic

Standing at over 6 feet tall, this 8th grader is a sight to behold on the field. Her presence is commanding, and her skills are unparalleled. Ila possesses all the qualities that coaches desire, including a fierce competitive spirit, exceptional control, and the ability to perform under pressure.

Her performance on the pitching mound has been nothing short of spectacular. Ila's fastball, curve, and rise are all under control, and she uses them to attack batters with precision. Her movement is exceptional, and she can overpower hitters with ease. Her addition of a changeup has caused many batters to lose their balance, making her a formidable opponent. She's also an impressive fielder, with great instincts and quick reflexes.

Ila is not only an excellent pitcher but also a powerful hitter. With an Exit velocity in the mid-70s, she's a force to be reckoned with at the plate. During the fall season, she hit back-to-back home runs against the Atlanta Vipers Crenshaw team, demonstrating her incredible power. Despite her height, Ila is surprisingly fast, with a home to first time of 3.0 seconds at the South Carolina team camp.

It's no wonder that Ila has caught the attention of Power 5 coaches across the country. She's one of the top pitchers in the 2028 class, and her impact on the game is undeniable. Since joining our team, she has been a cornerstone of our pitching staff, displaying exemplary work ethic and commitment. Ila is the kind of player that all coaches dream of having on their team, and for all of these reasons, she should be considered one of the top pitchers in her class.","GPA 4.0

She has one of the silkiest of smooth ball transfers and arm angles out there. Taylor is very quick on her feet, has no problem getting to small bloopers in the gaps and has a solid backhand as well. With Taylors speed and ability to read the ball off the bat, she also makes for a great outfielder for us as well. Taylor trains every day when not at the ball field and never settles for anything less than perfection. Taylor spends countless hours in her barn at home training before school, after school and before bed to make sure she gets her reps in and she is prepared every weekend. Taylor ""Biggie Smalls"" is of a smaller body build, but do not let that fool you as she packs power from the right side of the plate. Just recently over Winter, Taylor has also added slapping into her arsenal. She is a base stealing machine with her speed and loves to capitalize on minor mistakes by the defense and get an extra base out of it. Taylor has excellent fielding skills, a strong arm and quick reflexes. She definitely runs the bases with speed and agility.","4.0 GPA

Chloe can hit for power, drop a bunt down the line and easily beat out the throw with her speed, or switch sides in the box and slap a ball passed your defense. Chloe is one of the best and aggressive base runners in the game. She has that instinct to turn singles into doubles with ease and more times than none, is easily stealing a base on you. She is one of the smartest kids on and off of the playing field. At 10u, she was given the nickname ""Cannon"" and when you see her arm strength, you quickly realize why. Many coaches do not even attempt to run on Chloe when she is behind the plate, as the majority of the time, it results in an easy out. Her parents Wayne and Christen wear t-shirts that say across the back, ""send another one"" as Coaches know and respect her arm! Chloe has a work ethic that is like no other, that is for sure.

She plays a national 2027 schedule against older players. Last summer she played more 2026's than 2027's due to a National Showcase schedule. She consistently helps our team offensively and defensively. Leah enjoys playing against the older competition and playing with players who are older than her because she can learn from them and be challenged.

This past fall she made the RAY SEYMOUR ALL TOURNAMENT TEAM. She hit .364 and led our team in RBI’s that weekend. She helped her team beat Team North Carolina 2028 (Strugar pitched and was ranked #28 by Extra Innings last year) and Beverly Bandits Chow (PGF National Champions) this past fall.  Leah also helped lead the team in hitting in the SCENIC CITY POWER POOL where the team went 5-0 on the weekend getting a shoutout from Extra Innings for a wonderful weekend. Leah hit .571 that weekend with an OBP of .667 with two doubles. At Scenic City, Fury beat Top Gun 2027 with their top pitcher Kamryn Timmons on the mound. Leah knocked a double to the left field gap helping her team get the win. Kamryn was ranked as the #4 player in the country on Extra Innings last season. Also at Scenic City,  Leah was 1-2 against top ranked pitcher Khloe Burton who was ranked #48 in the class of 2028 rankings. In the Colorado Sparkler Supplemental Power Pool Leah  hit .438; OBP .500, OPS 1.000, SLG .500 Fielding Percentage 1.000. This helped our team place 20th out of 72 teams. Out of the 72 teams, only 10 teams were 13u teams. 

Leah’s been on Fury for the past three years playing and hitting against top teams. She helped her team this past fall beat Birmingham Thunderbolts-Rocky/Alford  4-3 at Show Me the Money with #8 ranked Addison Holcomb. She was 2-2 against Jadyn Hutchins this past fall who is ranked #31 by EI class of 2028.

Aubrey has an outstanding work ethic and settles for nothing less than perfection. Aubrey is one of the loudest kids on the playing field and is one of our biggest leaders every year, even on a bad day. Aubrey is well known for her crazy personality, quick hands and has one of the best fake throws that fools 90% of base runners typically resulting in an easy out. She is a fierce competitor and leader with extremely high softball IQ. She is not afraid to get in on the hot corner, with her quick reflexes she has the ability to make split second decisions. Aubrey packs a big bat at the plate and is great at finding gaps, not to mention one of the best small ball producers on our team.","3.5 GPA

Last Fall, Ryleigh pitched 60.2 innings and only walked 5 batters while recording 50 strike outs. Calling pitches is pretty easy for me when Ryleigh is in the circle seeing that she spins the ball in, out, up and down, not to mention a very nice off speed pitch. Ryleigh has a strong work ethic, she is very focused and has a good softball IQ and stays under control while in the circle showing no emotion. Ryleigh also carries tremendous power in the batters box and is capable of going yard at any point.","4.0 GPA

At a young age, Casey could drill her spots and had a phenomenal change up. I went after Casey pretty hard entering our 12u season. I knew this kid had what it took to get to the next level and really wanted to help get her name out there and get her the exposure she deserves. Casey's work ethic for her craft is like no other. Casey has the ability to pound the inside of the zone, work spin up, down, out and also has what I believe to be one of the best change ups in the game, often having batters fooled and way out in front of the ball. Not only is Casey a key role in our pitching rotation, but she also holds a 3.8 GPA at Anthony Wayne Jr High as an 8th grader. If you were to watch one of our games, regardless if Casey is in the circle, in the dugout or even having a bad outing, I can guarantee you will hear her voice. She is a big time leader on this team and is always picking up players. Casey is mentally tough and bounces back from failure. She is emotionless in the circle and controls the game.","3.8 GPA

She is also one of our best hitters, she hits in the middle of the lineup, we have refined her swing, her approach at the plate and she is crushing the ball, when we got her she struggled at the plate compared to where she is now, her exit velo was 59-60, now she is at 65-70mph).  Her families commitment says alot about her desire to continue to grow and compete at the elite level.  The commute from SW Oklahoma to DFW for practice every week, it is a 4 hour drive each way.

She displays incredible bat speed and exit velocity (65+ mph) as a hitter. A true line-drive hitter, she really displays an advanced approach at the plate, hunting the fastball and smoking balls to both gaps with regularity. She has often been mentioned by peers and other coaches as a player who hits the ball as hard as anyone they've seen at her age. Over the last full summer and fall seasons, Rylen has led our team in 2Bs, RBIs and is second in Runs. We have 3 slappers on the team who took our slugging percentage title - largely due to their speed - but Rylen finished with a .488 mark in both the summer and fall seasons. Defensively, Rylen excels in CF, using her long strides to close gaps and consistently dives or jumps to make highlight-reel catches. These plays have helped her turn 4 double-plays throughout last season.",Rylen was a USSSA All-American Games selection in  but couldn't attend due to tournament travel schedules. She is trying out again this weekend for the  games. She is active in her catholic and church communities while also obtaining a 3.9 GPA in school. Rylen enjoys physical fitness and lifting weights when she is not active in her softball training - which tends to take up the calendar.,"March  - PGF Bandits Power 80, Elizabethtown, KY

She is very likely the best in the 2028 class when it comes to picking errant throws out of the dirt and making clutch plays to end innings.

Offensively, Zoe is consistently around a .400 hitter. She steps up to the plate as a power lefty with the ability to drag bunt with speed when she needs to.

Sophia is an athlete that started in her developmental years playing up in 2027.  She was a part of Coach DeAnn Fox 2027 Shockwave team.  She then found a home at IMG 2010 Hoggatt where she has maintained her role as a consistent threat as both an offensive and defensive player.   She came out of the gates hot this  spring season in the first tournament batting 8/12.  This spring she a leader on her very competitive team with a batting average of .439 with 25 hits, 5 extra base hits, 13 RBI for the first 4 tournaments.

Madison is the type of player that her coaches, teammates, team parents, other team coaches and other team's players recognize her for her passion for the game, her work ethic, and especially her kindness. Madison is the type of player that puts her team and teammates first and herself last. The first one to the mound to check on her pitcher, the first one to set up equipment, first one to offer compassion to a down player. I can talk about stats and accolades, which I will, but first I would be remised to not mention what a special human being Madison Rogers is and a strong independent young woman she is becoming. Madison just makes the game fun to watch when she is a part of it, Chicago Cheetahs coach, Paige Stryczek recently expressed to me. In  Madison was ranked #47 overall and was so excited to get the news. But Madison did indicate that she wanted to work harder to move up the ranking ladder. Madison has understood that being in the weight room will only make her stronger and faster. Madison started a workout program and now works out three days a week in the weight room, on top of hitting five days a week, along with fielding work. Maddie is a triple threat at the plate that keeps other teams off balance. Madison, who hits from the left side, has the strength to hit a home run, shoot a line drive in the gap and at the same time, she can soft slap, hard slap, and slap bunt. With her speed of 2.75 home to first she keeps infielders on their toes. Add to that her power, explosive quickness and high softball IQ on the bases and it makes her dangerous in every aspect of the game. There is never hesitation on her part to take that extra base. Madison's quickness, speed, strong arm and strong glove makes her a perfect middle infielder. For the  season and Spring  season thus far, Madison has a .405 batting ave, and a .452 OBP. Currently, Madison has been invited and attended two OnDeck Jamboree camps and one OnDeck Elite Camp. Madison is currently ranked #7 in the country for the 2028 OnDeck class with her ODM score of 89.2586.","Madison Rogers volunteers every year with the Chicago Heights Police Department at Thanksgiving and Christmas time and delivers food to less fortunate families so they can have food for the holidays.

Offensively her ball off bat exit speed is 68 mph.  Her hand speed is freaky fast in the low 20s and she has tons of pop on her bat.  She is finally growing into her body and her power at the plate for a lefty is demonstrated on this Spring's #s.  She is a very selective hitter, we have been working extremely hard to get her to open up her hitting zone to expand to the rivers and be able to hit any/all balls that touch anywhere near the zone.  

Defensively she is such a diverse leader.  She normally starts at 1st base for me, her vocal leadership, game IQ and ability to keep the troops together during battle is top notch.  She has an overhand in the mid to low 60s.  She also is now pitching with much better velocity.  She is throwing 58 mph on her fastball and curve.  Her change is deadly at 43 mph and her ability to hide the ball makes her tough in the circle.

Just on her numbers alone she is a top 50 player nationally.  Add the fact that if I were to start a team tomorrow she would be the first call easily bumps her up to the top 20s.  Her parents are a little taller (over 6 feet) so we are hoping she can hit a growth spurt here this year.  If she's able to grow and continue to develop her strength, this kid will be a top 10 in the next few years.  She was ranked #39 in  across the Nation.

Player,,Jones,"Her Beverly Bandits coach prior to me did not nominate her last year.  Unfortunately and sadly, she was left out of 2028 nominations last season because of this coach.",DeAnn,Fox,thelifeofedge@aol.com,7656172113,TN Mojo 2027 Fox,Tennessee Mojo Fastpitch,Brooks Cherry,9312605175,TN Mojo 2027 Fox,Catcher,Teays Valley High School,,0.521,1.348,0.6033,1,106,0,106,NA,NA,NA,NA,1.70 as recorded by S30 West Coast in Las Vegas in Feb.,1/10/,"#10 Makayla “Mak” Jones, C/UTL (2028 Ashville, OH) 
SHE IS THE BEST teammate any player could ask for and a player every coach would adore.  She takes on any role you give her and goes 100% at it with a WE before ME attitude.  She is the one in the dugout that spreads the positive vibes, and you can count on her to keep the team's spirits up.  Mak is a team leader by words and action for TN Mojo 2027-Fox and she uses her position as catcher to use her leadership qualities to its fullest.  She is one of the top catchers in her 2028 class along with being a huge threat at the plate with a ceiling that remains uncapped.  This kid is a workhorse!  No one works as hard as Mak Jones.  She has all the tools and measurables that the power 5 schools will be after, and Mak has big dreams to get to that level.  Mak attends Field of Dreams (Columbus, OH) weekly catching lessons and participates weekly in the winter their Showcase Thursday Night High School Hitting League which is ran and organized by Shawn Gillenwater (hitting instructor drafted by Yankees) and Chris Zaker (catching instructor).  Mak puts a lot of time and effort into her craft as a catcher and has tons of support by going to countless lessons by some highly respected catching and throwing instructors. She has attended several catching lessons by Kristen Cox from Demand the Dish (Tampa, FL and remotely) and by Matt Pilewski with Performance Velocity Systems -PVS (Pittsburg, PA).  Currently she is the youngest PVS female to hit the 70mph mark in overhand throw.  She carries a commanding presence behind the dish with her cannon of an arm and has the pop time to second base at 1.7 as documented at PVS and at S30.  

This kid is a beast behind the plate and with the bat in her hand.  When people say hard work pays off…she is a great example of just that as she leads in several hitting stats for TN Mojo 2027- Fox.  In the summer of 2022, she also led in batting average for the Bandits 09 -Mercurio as well, so her track record of dominating hitting speaks for itself.   Mak is a key piece to our batting lineup as she has taken on the role as leadoff this season and has found her way to the top this past fall in stats as she led our team in batting average with .466, 113 PA, OBP .513, SLG .816, H 48, and collected team high 7 homeruns.  There is big time bat speed in this kid, and she has more natural power than anyone that I have seen in my 24 years of coaching softball.   Mak whips the barrel through the hitting zone with little effort.  She has faced some of the best pitching in the country and being a leadoff, she is attentive on picking up small details of the pitcher and prepping in the on-deck circle.  Mak has really taken off this  fall season as the player that can set the table quickly for us at the plate in the first few innings.  She has had some timely hits and momentum changing at bats for her team and has launched some absolutely nukes that leaves everyone in amazement.  She always seems to come up big and in clutch situations at the plate with runners on and in scoring position.  She barrels up a lot of softballs and can create some devastating blows to a defense with just one swing.","GPA 4.0

Peyton has been a big defensive leader behind the plate for the last 2 seasons for TN Mojo 2027 Fox.  She has been an integral part of the success of our team going 97-32 this past summer and 30-8 this fall playing in the top tournaments in the country such as Alliance Open Nationals 14U tied 3rd, LP4U Fall 16U Showcase finished Runners-Up in #1 bracket play, Easton Rawlings Showcase 14U tied 3rd, Scenic City Fall 14U finished 1st in pool.   Peyton is a fiery competitor and has shined brightest against the top teams we have faced. Peyton is one of the top catchers in the 2028 class demonstrating a quiet glove and elite receiving/framing ability as well as one of the best I’ve seen at blocking and handling wild pitches resulting in < 1 passed ball per game average. Her ability to win strikes at this age level has been crucial in helping our pitching staff be known as one of the top in the Midwest. Peyton demonstrates an above average arm (mid 60’s velo) and a sub 2.0 pop time in game to keep runners at bay.  Offensively, Peyton is one of the toughest outs in our lineup consistently coming in clutch in big moments. A middle of the lineup hitter, Peyton is top 2 in both BA .434 and OBP .505 in a stacked lineup of hitters. Peyton is a patient and strategic hitter who demonstrates line drive gap to gap power with the ability to also hit the ball deep.  Consistently performing at an elite level in the past with Beverly Bandits, Dreams, and now TN Mojo has earned Peyton S30 and Softball Factory All-American nods as well as past awards as Defensive MVP in USSSA All-American games.  Peyton is also a club volleyball player and team captain of her school team.  Peyton succeeds academically as well as a National Junior Honor Society member.  She is a well-rounded, hardworking student athlete and coachable player that coaches would love to replicate.","GPA 4.0

To know that this kiddo plays at the level she dose, and has only been playing Competitively for about just about 3 years is amazing. A true Power Hitter that can change the game in one swing , I'm sure glad she is in our line-up and we don't have to pitch to her anymore.



Santa Fe Inferno 09 HC Bam Donalson","Samantha's softball journey began at the age of 11. With both her parents and her aunt deeply immersed in high school and travel ball during their own childhoods, Samantha was practically born with a softball in hand. Her aunt's collegiate scholarship for softball and her father's seamless transition from baseball to men's fastpitch further fueled her passion.

However, residing in Miami posed a challenge as recreational leagues were scarce, exacerbated by the shutdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Undeterred, Samantha saw this as an opportunity for growth. Day in and day out, she dedicated herself to honing her skills, whether it was through playing catch, park practices with mom and dad, or solo tee-hitting sessions in the backyard.

In December of 2020, Samantha finally stepped onto the field for her inaugural real softball game, a moment that ignited an enduring love affair with the sport. By the summer of 2022, entering 7th grade at Florida Christian School, Samantha's dedication bore fruit as she not only made the varsity softball team but also secured a starting position in centerfield. Her performance was stellar, earning her accolades such as 2nd team all Dade, the team's Golden Glove award, and a batting average of .333.

Beyond the diamond, Samantha embodies a well-rounded lifestyle. Whether spending time at the mall working out or crafting culinary delights in the kitchen, she showcases her versatility. Academically, she excels, maintaining an impressive 4.14 GPA and earning a spot on the school's honor roll. With unwavering work ethic and boundless enthusiasm, Samantha eagerly anticipates the promising path ahead, both on and off the softball field.

Samantha's familial ties to softball run deep: both her mother and aunt were avid players during their youth, with her aunt even extending her career to join the Galveston Whitecaps. Following suit, Samantha's father seamlessly transitioned from baseball to men's fastpitch softball after his own playing days. He had the privilege of sharing the field with some of the sport's finest athletes. Before starting a family, they traversed far and wide for softball tournaments, and now, with children in tow, they find themselves embarking on similar journeys once more.","Visited FIU, FAU and UF plans to visit FGCU, Stetson, JU, and USF",https://extrainningsoftball.com/wp-content/uploads/gravity_forms/9-f1fff8c863198e54366b3b88d01eb3cb//04/Samantha-Otano-HS1.jpg,"https://extrainningsoftball.com/wp-content/uploads/gravity_forms/9-f1fff8c863198e54366b3b88d01eb3cb//04/8j5c2075-sam-swing-.jpg , https://extrainningsoftball.com/wp-content/uploads/gravity_forms/9-f1fff8c863198e54366b3b88d01eb3cb//04/Inferno-09-6.jpg , https://extrainningsoftball.com/wp-content/uploads/gravity_forms/9-f1fff8c863198e54366b3b88d01eb3cb//04/D35_5592.jpg"
